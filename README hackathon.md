## Introduction
The facial recognition technology project is a software application that uses computer vision algorithms to identify and verify individuals based on their facial features. The project aims to provide an efficient and accurate way of recognizing people in various settings, such as security systems, attendance tracking, and social media applications. The project can be used for real-time video streaming with face detection and recognition or for training models using external data sources.

We have made this project as a part of Rajasthan IT Day Hackathon.
### Problem Statement
Achieving strong accuracy is one of the major challenges in developing facial recognition technology(FRT). For instance, the face being presented to the system can have: Light variations, Misalighment in the face or variation in poses. Some type of occlusion etc.
### Key Outcomes Expected

*To do face recognition in real time.

*Enchance the Speed i.e. frames/sec.

*Do recognition on high camera resolution.

*Accurate enough to work with different image variations.

*Unbiassed to genders and races.

*Detect people through masks and other occulusions.
Difficult to exploit by criminals.

*Able to analyze 3D imaging.
